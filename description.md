This web application is a virtual diabetes risk calculator. When you visit the website, you're asked questions about your health and lifestyle, such as whether you would be classified as obese, your age, and if there's a family history of diabetes. After you answer these questions, the application uses a probabilistic model called a Bayesian network to estimate the probability of having Type 2 Diabetes based on your responses. The result is displayed on a separate page, and you can even calculate you risk again or share the results with others. This is not based on accurate data but rather estimation based on data. I am in the process of launching the website and if i do so, it will be on the domain name diabetesprobability.com.
